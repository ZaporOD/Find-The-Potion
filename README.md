Objectives for tomorrow (9/14/22):
1. Try to make the movement() function to change while in different map zones. 
2. Finish the forest, plains and village storylines. Try to finish mansion storyline.

Reminders:
1. Plains storyline - nothing happens at all. (Not sure yet.)
2. Village storyline - goblin is using the potion to attack the humans in the village.
3. Forest storyline - player and Sheila finds a note of the village attack plan. The goblins are attacking the east side of the village first. When the player goes to the 
village, they'll need to choose where to go first; east or west. If the players choose east then the goblin wouldn't have used all the potion yet and if west, you won't 
find the goblin and will automatically go to the east side of the village to find the goblin already used up all the potion and all the houses have been burned down.
4. Mansion storyline - by going to the mansion, the game ends with an ending that depends on what you did in the game.
